## [Unreleased]

## [1.1.0] - 2019-04-25
### Added
- Added Total Damage inflicted to server score board. This is the damage that explosions from a robot's shells have had on all robots, including the robot that fired the shell.

### Changed
- Fixed bug where alive robots were colliding with dead robots. Dead robots should not cause collisions.
- Added missing "pass" statement to Sitting Duck demo robot. Missing statement was causing Sitting Duck to not run.

## [1.0.1] - 2019-04-24
### Changed
- Fixed bug that was only allowing one less than botMsgsPerStep messages to be processed per robot per step. This was impacting any robots trying to send botMsgsPerStep messages in a single step as one of their messages was being incorrectly dropped.

## [1.0.0] - 2019-04-19
### Added
- More stats have been added to server score board.
- Added this CHANGELOG.md

### Changed
- Default game mechanics changed so it takes longer for robots to win. Damages have been cut in half and robot acceleration rate has been doubled.
- Viewer sends keep alive more often to ensure viewer is not dropped by server.
- NetBots now requires Python 3.6 or higher because server code started using f-strings.

## [0.9.0] - 2019-04-16
- Beta release.
